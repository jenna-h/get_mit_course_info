# Get MIT Course Info
I originally built this to deal with information from the Simmons DB (a database which is available only to Simmons residents) and see what the distribution of majors was (and how it compared to MIT's overall).

I've since augmented it to use kerberos IDs (and the MIT people directory), so other organizations (like clubs with mailing lists) can use it, too!
